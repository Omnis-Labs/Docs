# Problem

DeFi was built to democratize finance.\
Instead, it has trapped even sophisticated investors in a maze of spreadsheets, dashboards, and blind bets.

Despite billions of dollars flowing on-chain, DeFi risk management today remains dangerously immature.\
The tools serious allocators need simply don't exist.

## Four Core Problems

#### 1. Manual, Fragmented Strategy Management

Managing DeFi exposure today means juggling wallets, protocols, spreadsheets, and dashboards.\
There’s no unified way to track, control, or optimize positions across fragmented strategies and assets.

Every rebalance, every hedge, every adjustment requires painful manual work—introducing delays, errors, and missed opportunities.

***

#### 2. Information Asymmetry

Only quant elites—those with multi-million dollar infra budgets and in-house teams—can afford real-time risk control systems.\
Everyone else is left guessing:

* Where is my risk actually concentrated?
* How do my strategies interact?
* What happens if volatility spikes overnight?

Most whales and funds are operating with incomplete information—and they know it.

#### 3. No Real-Time Risk Control

In traditional finance, trading desks don't "guess" their way to profits. They **control risk first**.\
DeFi investors have no comparable tools.

Today, even high-value portfolios rely on slow manual rebalances or outsourced desks they barely trust.\
There is no live system monitoring risk stacking across strategies in real time.

***

#### 4. Invisible Risk Stacking Across Strategies

Risk isn't isolated.

Most investors unknowingly stack correlated risks across multiple protocols and strategies—exposing themselves to sudden, catastrophic drawdowns.\
Without an integrated view of their exposure, they can't predict, hedge, or adapt in time.

One bad market move, and what looked like “diversified” investments collapse together.

## What Happens if We Don't Fix This?

Left unsolved, DeFi investing remains what it is today:\
A semi-blind gamble where even smart allocators lose to hidden risks.

Capital will keep leaking out through blowups, hacks, volatility whiplash, and invisible systemic exposure.\
And DeFi will stay a playground for insiders—rather than a real capital market for serious money.

## The Market Has Changed. The Infrastructure Hasn’t.

In 2020, during DeFi Summer, nobody cared about risk—only crazy APRs.\
Today, investors care. Deeply.

They demand transparency, composability, real risk control.\
But DeFi tools haven't caught up.

Omnis exists to close that gap—and finally bring professional-grade portfolio management on-chain.
