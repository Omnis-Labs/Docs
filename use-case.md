# Use case

Meet Alex.

Alex is a serious DeFi investor managing a $500,000 portfolio across USDT, ETH, and BNB.\
He's experienced enough to know that chasing high APRs blindly is a recipe for disaster—and that spreadsheets and dashboards aren’t enough to manage risk properly at scale.

He wants three things:

* **Preserve capital** through intelligent, real-time risk control
* **Earn sustainable, compounding returns** without constant manual babysitting
* **Access professional-grade strategies** that he can’t build alone

## How Alex Uses Omnis

Instead of relying on fragmented dashboards or gut instinct, Alex connects his Binance Wallet to Omnis, securely linking his account to Aster DEX on BSC.

He chooses to use the **AI Portfolio Manager** — setting his preferred risk level as moderate, aiming for stable yield across ETH and BTC perpetual markets.\
Omnis automatically constructs a diversified trading strategy: hedging exposure, balancing leverage, and adjusting dynamically based on real-time market conditions.

Alex doesn’t need to manually rebalance, guess market timing, or stress over volatility spikes.\
The AI monitors everything — from individual vault performance to cross-strategy risk stacking — and adapts in real-time to changing market conditions.

Alex checks his dashboard weekly.\
Instead of huge swings or unexpected losses, he sees smooth, transparent, risk-adjusted performance—all on-chain, fully visible, and fully under his control.
