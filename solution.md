## Where We're Going Next

Perpetual DEX trading is just the beginning.

Omnis is expanding into:

* Yield strategies with lending protocols
* Yield strategies with **LSTs** (liquid staking tokens) and **LRTs** (restaking incentives)
* Stable, institution-grade **fixed-income strategies** backed by real-world assets (RWA)
* **DEX liquidity provision** and passive volatility harvesting
* **Airdrop farming** and strategic point-maximization across emerging DeFi ecosystems

Omnis is building the AI infrastructure to manage serious on-chain portfolios — not just for today’s DeFi, but for the next generation of decentralized finance.
