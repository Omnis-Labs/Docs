# Welcome

DeFi was supposed to democratize finance.\
Instead, it built a casino.

Today, serious investors—whales, DAOs, funds, and even experienced individuals—still struggle to manage fragmented on-chain exposure. Risk control is manual. Strategy building is reserved for quant elites. Spreadsheets and dashboards remain the norm.

Omnis exists to change that.
