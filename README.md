# Welcome to Omnis

DeFi was supposed to democratize finance.  
Instead, it built a casino.

Today, serious investors—whales, DAOs, funds, and experienced individuals—still struggle with fragmented on-chain exposure.  
Risk control is manual. Strategy building is reserved for quant elites. Spreadsheets and dashboards are still the default.

Omnis changes that.

We’re building an AI-powered DeFi portfolio manager that makes real-time risk control, automated strategy optimization, and sustainable returns accessible to everyone — not just institutions.

- No more spreadsheets.
- No more blind bets.
- No more guesswork.

Omnis is the infrastructure for serious capital in DeFi.

Welcome to the future of decentralized portfolio management.
